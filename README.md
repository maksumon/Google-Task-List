# Google-Task-List

This project has been developed for the purpose of using Google Tasks API in iOS app using OAuth2.0 & RESTful API. I've searched all over the internet to find a suitable library to develop an app to use Google Task API, but didn't find any. Then I developed my own using OAuth2.0 for login and RESTful API to ADD/Edit/Delete task list.

Hope you'll find this project useful.

Thanks
